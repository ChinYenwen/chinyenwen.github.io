  Hi, I'm Yen-wen Chin ‚Äî currently wrapping up my Master‚Äôs degree in Data Science, graduating in May 2025. I love using data and technology to solve real-world problems, especially when it means making systems more efficient and information more accessible.

  I‚Äôm originally from Taiwan, and part of the reason I came to the U.S. was to explore different ways of living and learning. I‚Äôve always been curious ‚Äî not just about how things work, but how people work together, and how technology can help us do that better.

  Over the past few years, I‚Äôve built full-stack applications, automated data pipelines, created Power BI dashboards for scientists and engineers, and integrated GPT-powered features into mobile apps. I enjoy working across disciplines, and I thrive when I‚Äôm learning something new.

  I‚Äôm currently studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification to strengthen my cloud skills, and I‚Äôm open to opportunities across the U.S. I‚Äôm happy to relocate ‚Äî and I do not require sponsorship for the next 3 years.

  Tools I love working with: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Powershell</mark>, <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Splunk</mark>, and <mark>Power BI</mark>.
