  Hi, I'm Yen-wen Chin — currently wrapping up my Master’s degree in Data Science, graduating in May 2025. I love using data and technology to solve real-world problems, especially when it means making systems more efficient and information more accessible.

  I’m originally from Taiwan, and part of the reason I came to the U.S. was to explore different ways of living and learning. I’ve always been curious — not just about how things work, but how people work together, and how technology can help us do that better.

  Over the past few years, I’ve built full-stack applications, automated data pipelines, created Power BI dashboards for scientists and engineers, and integrated GPT-powered features into mobile apps. I enjoy working across disciplines, and I thrive when I’m learning something new.

  I’m currently studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification to strengthen my cloud skills, and I’m open to opportunities across the U.S. I’m happy to relocate — and I do not require sponsorship for the next 3 years.

  Tools I love working with: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Powershell</mark>, <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Splunk</mark>, and <mark>Power BI</mark>.

          This diagram illustrates the automated alert processing pipeline I developed during my previous role. 
          The system retrieves scheduled reports from Splunk, processes and enriches the data, 
          and sends the output to an external ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) system for downstream consumption.
