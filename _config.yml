  Hi, I'm Yen-wen Chin — currently wrapping up my Master’s degree in Data Science, graduating in May 2025. I love using data and technology to solve real-world problems, especially when it means making systems more efficient and information more accessible.

  I’m originally from Taiwan, and part of the reason I came to the U.S. was to explore different ways of living and learning. I’ve always been curious — not just about how things work, but how people work together, and how technology can help us do that better.

  Over the past few years, I’ve built full-stack applications, automated data pipelines, created Power BI dashboards for scientists and engineers, and integrated GPT-powered features into mobile apps. I enjoy working across disciplines, and I thrive when I’m learning something new.

  I’m currently studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification to strengthen my cloud skills, and I’m open to opportunities across the U.S. I’m happy to relocate — and I do not require sponsorship for the next 3 years.

  Tools I love working with: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Powershell</mark>, <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Splunk</mark>, and <mark>Power BI</mark>.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          During my undergraduate years, I began a journey of self-discovery that led me to embrace my identity and advocate for equality. 
          I joined campus initiatives supporting LGBTQ+ voices and women's empowerment, and I became actively involved in social issues in Taiwan.
          This included participating in street campaigns, speaking out during public events, and encouraging voter turnout for major political causes such as recall elections.
